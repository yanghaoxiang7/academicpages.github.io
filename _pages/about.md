About me
======

I am a second-year master's student majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Currently I'm doing research on lysosomal quality control and molecular mechanism in aging and aging-related diseases at [Aging Institute](https://aging.pitt.edu/), [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPMC)](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/) with [Dr. Jay Tan](https://jaytanlab.org/). Earlier, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Turing Class](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/Education/Programs.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

Research Interest
======
My interest lies in understanding the key regulators of aging to develop targeted therapeutics with leading technologies. Specifically, I focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging, such as how to activate or reprogram existing mechanisms to slow down aging, how to utilize omics and computations to identify key regulators, and how to develop potential therapeutics for aging and aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Type 2 Diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. I hope to deepen our understanding of aging mechanisms and boost the development of therapies for age-related diseases alongside like-minded scientists.
