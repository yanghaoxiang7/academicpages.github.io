About me
======

I am a first-year PhD neuroscience rotation student at Johns Hopkins University.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Turing Class](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/Education/Programs.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) and Master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). 

My interest lies in understanding the key regulators of aging to develop targeted therapeutics with leading technologies. I did research on lysosomal quality control and molecular mechanism in aging and aging-related diseases at [Aging Institute](https://aging.pitt.edu/), [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPMC)](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/) with [Dr. Jay Tan](https://jaytanlab.org/) as mentor and closely work with [Dr. Toren Finkel](https://aging.pitt.edu/labs/finkel-lab/). See my Resume for a full list of experience.

Research Interest
======
I focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging, such as how to activate or reprogram existing mechanisms to slow down aging, how to utilize omics and computations to identify key regulators, and how to develop potential therapeutics for aging and aging-related diseases.
